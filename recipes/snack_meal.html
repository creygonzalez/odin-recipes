    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>If you're anything like me, there are some days where cooking a meal is the absolute <strong>LAST</strong> thing you want to do after a long day</p>
        <p>Instead, I like to do what I call, "Eating little bits of whatever I can find until the calories equate to a meal, or I'm full".</p>
        <p>If that feels too said, call it a makeshift charcuterie board without the board, presentation, or delicious assortment of meats, cheeses, crackers, and fruit. </p>
        <p>In this recipe, if you can call it that, we'll take a look at some of our options, as well as substitutions</p>

    <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Now, if you're anything like me, you live in what's known as an <em><strong>ingredients household</strong></em></p>
            <p>This just means that I don't keep around Doritos, or Fruit Roll Ups, or anything fun for that matter.</p>
            <p>I'll take you through what I have in my pantry at this moment in time, and we'll make a meal out of it</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Handful of salted peanuts</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Peanut butter or jelly</li>
            <li>Rice pudding</li>
            <li>Apples, although any fresh-ish fruit is okay</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Deli meat</li>
            <li>Pickles</li>
            <li>Popcorn</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>There isn't anything specific that's needed to be done here for prep. If you've got 10 minutes and a mildly stocked pantry, you're good to go</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Put your bread in a toaster</li>
                <li>While the bread is toasting, wrap the cheese in the meat. You can also eat them separately</li>
                <li>Eat the apple or fresh fruit</li>
                <li>Devour a few pickles. My favorite are butter pickles</li>
                <li>Might as well throw the popcorn in the microwave too</li>
                <li>Oh! The toast is done. Time to spread your condiment of choice (within reason please)</li>
                <li>Now that you've eaten everything else, time for dessert. Tonight for me, it's popcorn and rice pudding</li>
            </ol>
    </div>
    <p>And that's it! Super simple meal with no prep or thought involved. This is best served with a YouTube video about your favorite topic.</p>
    <p>Thanks for coming with me on this journey!</p>
